          As a product designer whoâ€™s worked in fast-paced startups, I developed
          a very strong instinct for interfaces <br />, patterns and
          interactions and helped build beautiful products.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I continued this tradition with my work at Pallet, where I learnt a
          lot on driving product decisions and <br /> brainstorming actual
          product development as well.
